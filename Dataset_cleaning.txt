1.
* changed "road" on I330 from A7 to A8

2.
* removed several nodes
** I226, I229, I231, I233, I235
** on the south coast near Marbelle
** the route there is divided into two roads
** this was now reduced to one route

3.
* deleted I56 to I63
** loop near Barcelona
** kept the more interesting road
** now the road is I54 -> I55 -> I64 -> I65

4.
* deleted I284, I285, I286
** on the south eastern coast, near Cartagena
** the nodes created a weird curve in the road
** can be omitted because probably no stations are needed so close to Cartagena

5.
* removed I293 and I294
** on the East Coast in the middle, north of Cartagena
** they loop weirdly
** now the road is I292 -> I295
