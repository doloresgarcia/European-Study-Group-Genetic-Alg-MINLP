## Optimal design of the Electric Vehicles's public charging network!

Special feature of the problem: different chargers disaggregated by type and considering 65 charging stations are already available.

Assumptions:
- We focus on the interurban behavior, which results in a road by road approach
-

Available data (Number EV, Battery size of the vehicles, Coordinates of IMD) can be checked at DataCheck.ipynb and the cleaning process.
