## Optimal design of the Electric Vehicles's public charging network!

Special feature of the problem: different chargers disaggregated by type and considering 65 charging stations are already available.

Assumptions:
- We focus on the interurban behavior, which results in a road by road approach
- Focus on Low total cost of building the charging stations and Low maximum waiting time at all stations, functions can be checked at the summary pdf.

Available data (Number EV, Battery size of the vehicles, Coordinates of IMD) can be checked at DataCheck.ipynb and the cleaning process.



Goal:
- The optimization problem formulated falls in the class of nonlinear integer programming (INLP) problems. 
The goal is to apply the genetic algorithm to both single and multi-objective cost functions.
